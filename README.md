accessing my short notes with keywords
**I initiated this GitHub project to address real-world issues in my life. As an python developer, I often need to take notes, but I've encountered challenges in organizing and retrieving them efficiently. There have been instances when I couldn't locate specific notes or even forgot about some of them. However, this project simplifies the process by providing a keyword-based search functionality, making it effortless to access my concise notes from anywhere in the world.**
